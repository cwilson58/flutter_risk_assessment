# NA Testing

1. Click the assess button
2. default vote counts [0,0,0,0] all display as a red goal
3. set low risk metric vote count to 1, metric risk is set to green [0,0,0,1]
4. set votes counts to [0,1,0,0] metric risk is now yellow
5. Create a new metric and set all descriptions, if a description was left blank it is filled in with the placeholder value
6. running through the whole assessment process if half the metrics are green and half are red the total metric is yellow, as expected
7. edit descriptions, enter all keyboard characters into title field, \*note text size in field inputs scales based on amount of text in the field
8. Entering javascript <script> injecting into to text boxes to test if it will log into console, doesnâ€™t seem to have any effect
9. Entering a space character or blank symbol the fields just show up blank, no errors
10. when resizing the screen to all sizes there are no errors thrown by the widgets
11. when clicking add metric there is no option to cancel, it immediately puts you into assessment mode
12. In assessment mode directly from creating a new metric editing other metrics fields still works as intended and updates the list

# Feedback

1. outputs as expected, simple to use
2. Addition of an option to cancel adding a metric would be beneficial
